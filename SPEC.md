# Roslin Specification

# Let's set the scene

This document outlines the specification for roslin which is a reactive runtime for board games. Roslin is designed as a UX mirror to [Adama](https://github.com/mathgladiator/adama-lang), and the expectation is that Roslin + Adama = a game.

**About the name:** [roslin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Roslin) is derived from [Battlestar Galatica](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407362/) which is how the author and his wife named their goats.

## Goals &amp; Requirements

* Provide a fantastic user experience for board game players on multiple devices (tv, gameboard, phone, tablet)
* Serve as a mostly-logic-free template engine to turn a streaming-JSON object into an interactive image.
* Small footprint and lean implementation for low-end devices and battery friendly execution
* The format should be easily edited by humans and tools

## Non-goals

This runtime should extend beyond board games, but this is the path towards madness. The initial version should be 100% focus on board games and the challenges presented by them. Focus!

# Format

Roslin is plain-ole JSON structured under a schema that we will describe as this document unfolds.

## Top level

The root object of the format has XYZ fields which are 

* assets
** search
* forest
* setup

## Assets

The root field "assets" is an object providing a mapping of names (i.e. asset ids) to assets which the system can pre-load. An asset is an object with a required "url" string field, and "url" represents a file like an image, movie, svg, audio, nine-path image, etc. The "url" identifies the location of the asset's resource and may point to an online resource via HTTP or a local resource. For convenience, an optional top level field called "search" provides an array to provide the runtime a path to search for the resources. The "url" must contain an extension to indicate the nature (image, animation, movie, audio) of the resource.

Beyond mapping asset ids to files, the asset object is opportunity to provide parameters on how that particular asset is to be used. For example, a nine-patch image requires four integer values as to how to slice the image up to scale. Similarly, a set of assets may share a file with different parameters so tile-maps and tile-assets may be used.

### 'assets' example ###

```js
{
    "search": ["https://mydomain.com"]
    "assets" : {
        "my-card-back": {
            "url":"cardback-01.png"
        }
    }
}
```
